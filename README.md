# ReactGoogleMaps
Simple React App that marks the locations and titles of all the major universities in Texas.

## Motivation
This project was created for two primary reasons. The first reason is so I could become more familiar with the React framework, and the second reason is so I could figure out how to make calls to a REST API in JavaScript. Another added benefit of this project is that the Google Maps API has been on my checklist of useful API's to learn for awhile now.
